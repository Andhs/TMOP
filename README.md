# TMOP - Translation Memory Open-source Purifier


TMOP is an open-source software written in Python and its goal is to clean and maintain large Translation Memories. It is an open-source software written in Python designed for cleaning and maintaining a Translation Memory (``i.e.`` a collection of ``(source, target)`` segments, called Translation Units, used to aid human translators operating in a Computer-assisted Translation framework). 

The goal of TMop is to identify and remove from the TM all the "bad" TUs,  in which any of the two textual elements is either: 

1) syntactically poor, 
2) semantically different from the other,
3) awkward according to some formatting criteria. 

TMop has been developed at Fondazione Bruno Kessler with the support of the European Association of Machine Translation (EAMT). It can be downloaded as a package including: software, documentation, toy data and evaluation scripts.
